    quote: `It's not a city. It's the lens I look at Pakistan with.

It's the mother who never tires. who never sleeps.

My relationship with Karachi is a love-hate one: love because of everything I got from her and hate because I don't believe I will find another Karachi out there.

The stories - the people of every culture and color - the capability of all of us coming together and making this stupidly dysfunctional system work - it's more than survival instinct - it is the toxic manifestation of our love for this city.

I can say this one thing about Karachi surely: maybe I can leave Karachi, but Karachi will never leave me. It is a part of me. It is what I look at in the mirror.

I am grateful for receiving so much from Karachi and disappointed at being able to give back so little.

Karach meri jaan - I love you.`,

    quote: `I was born and raised here in karachi.

i came to my senses, remembering my father used to take me and my siblings to the near by parks often, we used to enjoy the small rides, hustle and bustle of people around.
People always facinated me as i used to observe every single story around me, in different races, colors and languages, I always held questions in my mind, to get close to people and ask them who they are.
I genuenly held this curiousity of getting to know people and their stories, that's what always contributed to the part of my heart pumping.
Growing up in karachi I remember to be in a neighbourhood, the people of these numbered houses were kind and sweet, there was a Almond tree I remember in a house we used to buy those from, life was perfect I remembered the unity and love among all the members of those homes.
As the time passed we shifted to a new location and it was rushy, and on the top floor of a building.
Life started to get a little different for me as i recall, I was mildly unsatisfied, if i say i was just ok, from then on I started going to the new school and discovered the little playground nearby which were just two roads making an illusion of a ground, I discovered nearby shops and mosque.
Life was good until I started facing bullying, it was not race specific but still I was bullied to my core, I chose Isolation as a child which was the smartest move but a good one.
Apart from bullies playing their active role in ruining mychildhood, the adults also played an extra role, by planting bombs and threatening businesses nearby, governments were unstable and loot was on the rise, political conflicts were on the rise and much more.
I remembered going for outing one day with our below floor neighbours to Aladin park, they strictly instructed me not to speak pashto anywhere, I was like okay! quite strange but life saving as these racist conflicts were on the rise, and I remember I as a kid used to drop my tusion teacher to the bus stop to provide her safer passage, if someone ever asked anyone of us about our race, so that either of us can speak our native language to save both of us from getting burned or getting shot.
The good part of this all was, it was never the ordinary residents, we always loved each other and never saw races, colors nor laguages.
We eventually grew tired of this and moved to Swat, and there I Spent the most heavenly and Peaceful 6 Years of my Life, learning my language more better, my culture and most of all, observing the beauty of unity, families and people, it gave me a new perspective about things and humans, I learned a ton! and discovered many new and different cultures amongst our own, seeing racism in the mountains too, but not at extreme.
As the time passed I moved to Karachi again, and here now I was starting from scratch again, I saw things from a new perspective and fresh.
Spending time here gave me the realization that I'm feeling homesick, even living with my family.
It was a different feeling, It was not that I was missing my Kin, but the Presence of unity in the air was nowhere to be seen.
People in the city are just too much into themselves.
They barely are united or connected by any strong means or by a common ideology.
I still feel homesick on major events like Eid and other similar days often, it is not that i've isolated myself, but the feeling of lacking unity in the air.
But It never stopped me from meeting amazing people, I still have that curiousity to meet new people and get to know them and ask them a ton of questions. 
As i believe when differnt cultures meet, they have potential to bring a very positive change and exchange of knowledge , along with that the opportunities to work towards solving problems together and better.
it's been 4 years here now, and I don't know my neighbours name yet, we hardly interact, and that's fine, we should respect each other's space, sometimes I think maybe if I'm in the wrong neighbourhood, but it is very common around here in the city.
what we need is a common ideology and flag to live under, that's what will make a real difference.
We as people are very beautiful and kind seeking connections and love, but divided by the moles amongst us who sow the seed of hatred, language, race, political parties and in the most common setting; teams.
In the end I'd love to include verses from the Holy Quran as Allah's words are the best.
Allah says in the Quran: "O mankind! Indeed We created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may ˹get to˺ know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware."
And one quote very dear to my heart from the last cermon of the Prophet Peace be upon him, as he said: "All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab"`,
